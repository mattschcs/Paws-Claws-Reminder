App Name: Paws & Claws Reminder 

Theme: Pet Care Reminder

Target Audience: Pet Owners

## Problem Statement: 
Busy pet owners sometimes struggle to remember essential care tasks like feeding, vet appointments, walking, and grooming, which can affect their pets' health and well-being. And miscommunications between large families with pets can lead to these tasks being done twice or not at all. Paws & Claws Reminder solves this by providing timely and organized notifications to help pet owners stay on top of their pets' care needs.


# 5 screens:
- Profile for pet, have multiple profiles under 1 account
- Login page (user & password OR Access Key?)
- Add tasks (for the first time)
- update/ report task (example every time you feed, walk, clean your pet)
- Send reminders (text)
- Upload photos (saved as a string like a URL String in the database)
- Optional: scoreboard
- Optional: share status with other users and friends (like a access string key variable in the database)

## Core User Stories: 
- As a user, I want create pet profiles so that I can track a specific pet care
As a user, I want to be able to add tasks that I need to do for my pet with recurring dates and times so that I can make sure I remember to feed my pet on time.
- As a user, I want to update and report tasks with the date and time so that I can keep a detailed record of completed activities and ensure I’m staying on track with my pet’s care routine.
- As a user, I want to receive text reminders for important tasks so that I never forget to complete essential care activities for my pet.
- As a user, I want my other family members (or roommates) to be able to access the same account, so we can all see if our pet has been fed and walked that day. I want to avoid feeding our pet two dinners.

## Optional User Stories: 
- As a user, I want to upload photos of my pet so that I can document their growth and milestones.
- As a user, I want to share the status of my pet tasks with other users so that everyone can know that I am such a great owner.
